"""Run events: the structured stream a run emits as it happens.

The graph emits events through an :class:`~shipment_agent.ports.EventSink`
(see ``ports.py``) — the pipeline itself never prints or serialises;
each surface attaches the sink it needs:

- the CLI (``--stream``) attaches :class:`PrintingSink` and shows the
  run live;
- the API's ``POST /shipments/analyze/stream`` attaches a queue-backed
  sink and forwards the events as Server-Sent Events;
- tests attach :class:`CollectingSink` and assert on the sequence.

Event types: ``run_started``, ``node_started``, ``node_finished``
(carries ``duration_ms``), ``tool_called``, ``guardrail_verdict``,
``repair_attempted``, ``run_completed`` (carries the final status),
``run_failed`` (carries the clean error message). Events fire in the
offline fallback exactly as in provider mode — durations are real
wall-clock measurements either way.
