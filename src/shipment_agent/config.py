"""Runtime configuration: environment variables + an optional ``.env`` file.

All provider/API configuration comes from environment variables — nothing
is hardcoded beyond the defaults documented in ``.env.example`` and the
README's configuration table.

At startup the entry points (API, CLI, demo) call :func:`load_dotenv`,
which reads a ``.env`` file when one exists — first in the current working
directory, then at the repository root. The parser is deliberately small
and built in (no third-party dependency): ``KEY=VALUE`` lines, ``#``
comments, optional surrounding quotes, optional ``export`` prefix.

Precedence rule: a variable already set in the real process environment
always wins. ``.env`` only fills in variables that are not set, so CI and
production environments override the file.

    "default" filters at import time, jumping ahead of any filter set
